I am a young and enthusiastic software developer with a background in the aerospace industry and electrical engineering. Since early high school, I've been coding flight software for CanSat satellites in pure C. My pet projects include home automation systems, websites and model rocket payload electronics. Be sure to check out my flagship project - a real-time operating system kernel for 8-bit microcontrollers.

As I have just graduated from school, I may not have much experience in the field, but this is one of my key advantages - I can learn fast. Because of my aerospace background, I fear no challenge and can perform complex tasks in most stressful environments.
